# wordSearch
This program first asks the user for a location name from where to read the file
and a location name where to save the output file.
Then, it reads the contents into an array ignoring the single character words.
Sorts the contents of the array in alphabetically ascending order and
then start a loop to allow the user to search for one or more words in the array
If the word is found, the program gives the output which array location the word was found in,
if not found then it prints an appropriate message.
